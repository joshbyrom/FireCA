Fire Prediction and Simulation -- An Experiment in JavaScript
====================================

A two-dimensional CA with uniquely predetermined cell states between time (t) transitions. A simplified model of how a fire spreads and the subsequent regrowth of trees. In the model a cell will be one of three states: empty land, tree-filled land, or burning and on fire.



Probablistic CA
-------

The probablity of a tree-filled cell being struck by lighting are: 0.03 percent

The probablity of a tree-filled cell beside a burning tree-filled cell are: 6.65 percent

The probablity of a land cell becoming a tree-filled cell are:
	1. when neighbored by other tree-filled cells: (2.5 * number of trees nearby) percent
	2. when not neighbored by any tree-filled cells: 5 percent


Notes
-------

This is a simplified CA model of fires spreading through forests, but with a few simple modifications could be made into almost any CA. By default the simulator will run forever, but can be instructed to run only a set number of times inside of the main function.
